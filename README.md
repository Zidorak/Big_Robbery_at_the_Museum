Big Robbery at the Museum (BRATM) is a first person 3D level based on the 1500's, where you play as a burglar master called Emilia Santos, who has to steal a valuable chalice.   
In order to make the game challenging and fun at the same time, there are two core mechanics that allow the player to get into the room with the chalice. 
The first is a flash light, which runs out of battery over time. Picking up batteries will allow you to replenish the life of your torchlight and this will make exploring the game easier.
The second core mechanic is picking up four coloured keys in order to unlock and open the Goal Door that contains the Chalice. Also, there is a key that appears in front of the player at the start of the game, which can open all of the other doors, but just one at a time, if the player wants to open a new door, it has to retrieve the key from the last door opened.
This game is inspired by Alan Wake 2, where they use a flashlight/batteries mechanic to deal with the shadows, and the enemies are inspired by Doctor Whoâ€™s Weeping Angels.
